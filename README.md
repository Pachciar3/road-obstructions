# Obstructions on polish roads
Vanilla.js app which view list of obstruction on polish roads(highways, expressways, national roads). It allows to filter by voivodships, searching by a selected phrase and by a selected route

## Technology
The project was made with Vanilla.js, AJAX and PHP. I used [GDDKIA](https://www.gddkia.gov.pl/) API. I must have written back-end code in PHP, because of CORS policy.
